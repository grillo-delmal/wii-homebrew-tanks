# Tanks

This is an old homebrew game I programmed during a weekend in 2008. 
It was published in the [wiibrew wiki](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Tanks) and 
downloadable through the wii homebrew channel app.

This repository is mainly for archival purposes.

# Build?

I lost the original dev environment, but to build this you would need the following dependencies

  * [Wiiuse](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiiuse)
